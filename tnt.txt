Calling your function get_next_line in a loop will then allow you to read the text
available on a file descriptor one line at a time until the EOF.
Make sure that your function behaves well when it reads from a file and when it
reads from the standard input.
libft is not allowed for this project. You must add a get_next_line_utils.c file
which will contain the functions that are needed for your get_next_line to work.
Your program must compile with the flag -D BUFFER_SIZE=xx. which will be used
as the buffer size for the read calls in your get_next_line. This value will be
modified by your evaluators and by moulinette.
